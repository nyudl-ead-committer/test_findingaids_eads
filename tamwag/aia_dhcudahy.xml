Of particular interest in the collection is a series of photographs, many collected by her father of famous musicians, many others unidentified but documenting life of Irish Americans in New York. Several photographs of Dorothy Hayden Cudahy at organized events or with the Dorothy Hayden Cudahy's Irish Steppers are also included.

            <p>The collection consists of the personal papers of Dorothy Hayden Cudahy, host of 
                <emph>Irish Memories</emph>, and her husband John J. Cudahy. These records include correspondence, photographs, financial documents, editorials written by John Cudahy, and professional achievements, such as Dorothy Cudahy's position as the first female St. Patrick's Day Parade Grand Marshall and John Cudahy's assignment in the United States Army. Also included are ephemera such as holiday cards and photographs, primarily of Dorothy Hayden Cudahy at organized events or with the Dorothy Hayden Cudahy's Irish Steppers.</p>
            <p>The major part of the collection comprises audio recordings, reflecting forty years of radio broadcasting for the Irish community in New York City. In addition to playlists, local advertisements, and other documentation of the weekly programme 
                <emph>Irish Memories</emph>, this collection includes more the 1,200 commercially produced LPs, several hundred 78s, and dozens of tapes, including some interviews. Inventories are available for the 33 rpm records (19 boxes) and the 78 rpm records (6 boxes). There currently are no inventories available for the 45 rpm records (4 boxes) and the reel-to-reel cassette tapes (4 boxes). The reel-to-reel, 8-track, and cassettee tapes include music, sponsor ads, and tapings of Hayden Cudahy's radio program. Some of the reel tapes were also transferred to Cd-Rom and this is noted in the reel listings in 
                <emph render="bold">Series VI</emph>. The cd's themselves do not contain descriptive labels; rather a number. These are sometimes found on the related reel tape but not in all instances.</p>
            <p>Musicians and musical groups represented in the collection include The McNulty Family, the Gallowglass Ceili Band, the Tulla Ceili Band, the Clancy Brothers, the Boys of the Lough, the Bothy Band, Clannad, the Chieftains, and the Wolfe Tones. Some of these groups incorporate Celtic and American folk elements into the traditional form. Individual artists include John McCormack, Michael Coleman, Willie Brady, Delia Murphy, Anne Greehy, Michael O’Duffy ( 1959-1970), Birdie Gallagher, Carmel Quinn, Teres Duffy, Ruby Murray, Frank Patterson, Connie Foley, Mary McGonigle, Dermot O’Brien, Jackie Roche (1957-1974) and Paddy Noonan.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest are a collection of Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann tours of the United States and Canada, circa 1972-1989 (incomplete); two tribute albums to President John F. Kennedy (including his address to Dail Eireann); and the albums of various New York Emerald Society Pipe bands.</p>
            <p>Illustrated record jackets in 
                <emph render="bold">Series V. Commercial Recordings </emph>provide a collection of images, originating both in Ireland and in the United States and targeted for Irish American consumption. Liner notes and sleeves offer information on performers, especially on some of the less documented traditional artists like Felix Doran, “The Last of the Traditional Pipers.”</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Dorothy Hayden Cudahy was born May 29, 1922 in Manhattan. She is the daughter of James Hayden, a native of Ballyraggett, Co. Kilkenny, and Delia Brennan, a native of Curry, Co. Sligo. She married John Cudahy (1920 -1994), the son of Co. Clare immigrants, in 1947 and they had one son, Sean (1950 – 1997). In 1960, Dorothy Hayden was one of the first meter maids for the New York City Department of Traffic and by 1982 retired as the Chief of Administration of the Bureau of Enforcement of the NYC Transportation Department. Then in 1984 she was the first woman, as well as the first American-born person, to be elected president of the Kilkenny Association, and in 1989 she was again honored as the first woman Grand Marshall of the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade. She and John Cudahy were active all their lives, both as members and officers, in Irish organizations.</p>
            <p>James Hayden, a well known emcee and columnist for the Irish Echo, began broadcasting the Irish Memories radio programme in 1930 over local station WEVD. Upon his death in 1943, his daughter succeeded as the host of Irish Memories and she continued broadcasting until the late 1980s. The weekly programme consisted of musical selections, news, advertisements and occasionally interviews. In addition to her program, in 1950, Ms. Cudahy created a group called the Dorothy Hayden Entertainers with dancers, musicians and entertainers. In 1951 the group even appeared on the Ed Sullivan show.</p>
            <p>The 33 rpm and the 78 rpm album collections form the core of recorded music which Dorothy Hayden Cudahy broadcast weekly over various local New York radio stations as part of the Irish Memories programme. The albums were acquired directly from the artists or purchased during trips to Ireland.</p>
            <p>The 33 rpm LPs in the collection include recordings made in New York, Boston, and other parts of North America, in addition to some made in Dublin but pressed in New York. All types of Irish music are featured in the collection, from artists working on both sides of the Atlantic including sean nos singing, ceili bands, show bands, and popular songs. Traditional music, for example, ranges from performances in Ireland to the recordings of its proponents who emigrated to the United States. Many musicians produced their own albums and those of other musicians. This collection documents how mobile Irish musicians were grouping and regrouping over the decades.</p>
