(The Web Archiving Service was made possible with support from the National Digital Information and Infrastructure Preservation Program and the University of California, as part of a project to preserve born-digital political communication.)

This collection contains periodically archived websites of (principally) Marxian inspired entities, including political parties, that identify with or are inspired by Communist, Socialist, or Trotskyist perspectives. While the focus is on the United States, selected international sites, especially those documenting the history of these movements, are also archived.

            <p>This web archive contains periodically archived websites of (principally) Marxian inspired entities, including political parties, that identify with or are inspired by Communist, Socialist, or Trotskyist perspectives. While the focus is on the U.S., with a particular focus on New York City, selected international sites, especially those documenting the history of these movements, are also archived.</p>
            <p>Classic Marxian doctrine advocates collective ownership of the means of production, to be achieved by the political struggle of the working class via political parties and labor unions, and the eventual withering away of the state.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of this archive, Communist organizations are understood as those that supported or now align themselves with the ideology and politics of the former Soviet Union and the associated international Communist movement that arose in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, or with the Chinese revolution (Maoism), or other schisms in the international Communist movement; Trotskyist organizations are those rooted in Leon Trotsky's critique of the Soviet Union, which he helped to found; Socialist organizations, including social democratic organizations (progressive organizations with socialism as an ultimate, if distant goal), include those rooted in the pre-1917 socialist movement, and reject the Communist ideal of a one-party state.</p>
            <p>NOTE: For technical, privacy and other reasons, archived websites may not be exact copies of the original website at the time of the web crawl.</p>

            <p>The Tamiment Library Web Archive (Labor and the Left): Communism, Socialism, Trotskyism, along with other topically based web archives relating to labor and the left, was created with the Web Archiving Service from the California Digital Library. This service employs open source web archiving utilities developed by Internet Archive with the support of the The International Internet Preservation Consortium. The Web Archiving Service was made possible with support from the National Digital Information and Infrastructure Preservation Program and the University of California, as part of a project to preserve born-digital political communication. The role of the Tamiment Library during this project and thereafter was/is to create topically based archives of websites documenting contemporary and ongoing labor and left activity, as well as the history of labor and the left, principally in the United States, with a special concentration on New York City.</p>

                        <abstract id="ref93" label="Abstract">The Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), founded in 1919 by members of the left wing of the Socialist Party USA, one of many such parties worldwide inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917, played an important role in the labor movement, particularly in the building of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, in struggles for civil rights for African Americans, while its cultural initiatives attracted a number of prominent artists and intellectuals, and its struggles to attain and maintain its legality were an important chapter in the history of U.S. civil liberties. Today the CPUSA continues its struggle for socialism, peace, and social and economic justice, and publishes a newspaper, the Peoples Weekly World, a monthly journal, Political Affairs (both captured within this website) and through its Labor Commission, the online periodical Labor Upfront (separately captured as part of this project)</abstract>
