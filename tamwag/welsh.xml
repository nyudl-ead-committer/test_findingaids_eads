            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Edward Kay Welsh (1902-1979) began his career as a union organizer in 1930. In the 1940s, he was hired by the CIO to organize workers in the steel, auto, and textile industries in the United States, and in 1950 he traveled to the Panama Canal Zone to organize laborers there. In 1961, the AFL-CIO sent Welsh to Africa as part of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) to assist various African trade union movements. He spent three and a half years in Africa. The collection documents Welsh’s trade-union work in the United States and Africa, as well as some of his nonunion activities.

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Edward Kay Welsh was born in New York City in 1902. As a teenager he worked at the old Metropolitan Opera House opening carriage doors for opera-goers. He also worked as a laborer; ditch digger, elevator operator, store clerk, shipping clerk, and longshoreman.</p>
            <p>Welsh's career in the union movement began in 1930, when he worked as a volunteer organizer for ILGWU Dressmakers Local 22. Soon he became involved in radical politics, traveling with Communist Party notable Jay Lovestone and others to the Soviet Union. During that visit, Stalin hoped to secure Welsh's support among blacks in the United States. But his close-up exposure to Soviet society caused Welsh to alter his political allegiance. Nevertheless, his continuing concern for workers' rights led him to carry out his political work through the labor movement, in writing, speaking and teaching.</p>
            <p>During the 1940s Welsh was appointed to the staff of Allan Haywood, vice president and director of organization of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, where he organized workers in the steel, auto, and textile industries in the South and in Ohio.</p>
            <p>In 1950 Welsh was sent to the Panama Canal Zone by CIO president Philip Murray to organize workers there. Within a year, with Welsh's help, 5,500 workers were enrolled in Local 900 of the Government and Civic Employees Organizing Committee. In 1953 Welsh returned to New York City, where he organized office workers. Moving on to Detroit, he conducted worker education and political action programs.</p>
            <p>AFL-CIO president George Meany assigned Welsh to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in 1961; his assignment was to assist trade union movements in Africa. During this period, the AFL-CIO sought out African union leaders to further the United States' political and economic interests in Africa. Sanctioned by the Department of State and the CIA, African labor leaders were given secret undercover support.</p>
            <p>Welsh spent three and a half years in Africa organizing agricultural, textile, hotel, and building and construction workers. He returned to the United States in 1964 to work with taxicab drivers and hospital workers, before retiring in 1967. Welsh died in February 1979, at the age of 77.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Edward K. Welsh Collection reflects Welsh's trade-union work in both the United States and Africa for the AFL-CIO and the ICFTU; earlier files shed light on Welsh's organizing efforts in the United States for the CIO and the AFL-CIO, as well as some of his non-union activities.</p>
            <p>Many files in the collection provide insight into the formation and development of the trade union movements in African countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Liberia, and Tanganyika; criticism by African affiliates of the ICFTU administration; and the split between the All-African Trade Union Federation and the ICFTU. Papers also document conspiracy and bribery charges within the Kenya Federation of Labour, some of which implicate the CIA.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I: Correspondence, Biography, and Speeches, 1939-197</emph>1, includes Welsh's personal and political correspondence (mostly incoming), notes, a poem, and speeches made prior to his departure for Africa, during his career as labor organizer. Also included is a short biographical sketch. Among Welsh's correspondents are W.E.B. Du Bois, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, Bryher, Averell Harriman, A. Philip Randolph, Lewis Corey; Allan S. Haywood; Jay Lovestone, director of the Department of International Affairs, AFL-CIO; Clement K. Lubembe, deputy general secretary of the Kenya Federation of Labour; and Tom Mboya, general secretary of the Kenya Federation of Labour and Chairman of the ICFTU Area Committee for East, Central, and Southern Africa.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II: CIO and AFL-CIO Files, 1937-1974</emph>consists of correspondence, minutes, telegrams, resolutions, lists, leaflets, programs, invitations, employment permits, leases, and addresses and speeches. Some materials document Welsh's work for the CIO (1937-1955) as a Field Representative organizing workers in the North and South, and in the Canal Zone. Other files concern his membership in the NAACP (1957-1959) and later union activities during the 1950s and 1960s. These include organizing drives to unionize black workers, an effort which contributed to the formation of the Negro American Labor Council (1959-1960). These files provide insight into Welsh's early career as labor organizer.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series III: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) Files, 1958-1971</emph>, includes correspondence, telegrams, reports, agendas, circulars, speeches, photographs, documentation of financial transactions, and news releases. Of particular interest is material on Welsh's appointment as ICFTU representative in Africa (1961-1964), and reports on union activities in Liberia, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika (1958-1962). Also included is a list of ICFTU field representatives in Africa, Asia, and Latin America (1958-1963); a draft of the Constitution of the Confederation of East African Trade Unions (1963-1971); a report on the First All-African Trade Union Conference; and records of the Pan-African Trade Congress held in Casablanca (1961). Additional documents deal with CIA involvement in Kenya (1962); the formation of the African Labour College in Uganda (1961-1964), which provided educational training for trade unionists in Africa; and the opposition to Tom Mboya's affiliation with the ICFTU by African countries that wanted to operate independently (1961-1963). The series also includes speeches made by heads of African states at a summit conference held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (1963); a description of union activity and efforts to create a national trade union center in the Sudan (1960-1963); and financial accounts and a proposed program of organization and education within the Kenya Federation of Labour (1962-1963).</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series IV: African Pamphlets and Periodicals, 1956-1972</emph>. A substantial portion of these periodicals concern trade union activities in East and West African countries. Most of the pamphlets relate to nonunion activities, but there are a few pamphlets published by the ICFTU, the International Labor Organization (ILO), and the United Nations. There are three folders of miscellaneous pamphlets and periodicals with no direct bearing on trade unions in Africa. These publications will serve the researcher who is viewing the trade union movement from an African perspective.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series V: Clippings, 1956-1965</emph>. These files are a rich source of materials for research into African trade-union activities. Most clippings include dates, but only a few include the names of the newspapers. One file is from the U.S. press.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VI: African Newspapers 1955-1964</emph>. This miscellaneous selection of issues contains material relevant to trade-union history in various countries of Africa.</p>
