            <p>Ralph Fasanella was a self-taught painter whose large, detailed works depict urban working life. The child of Italian immigrants, Fasanella was born and raised in the Bronx and later became a member of United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) Local 1227 while working as a machinist in Brooklyn. Fasanella also fought in the Spanish Civil War with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and after returning from the war began to work as a union organizer for the UE. This small collection consists of 32 b/w Spanish Civil War photographs most roughly measuring 2.5"x1.5. Also includes jacket and trousers worn by Fasanella in Spain. The collection also contains correspondence, materials from Fasanella's 1949 campaign for New York City Council, exhibit materials, lecture notes, and press clippings. A second donation to the collection includes "Un Ano de las Brigadas Internacionales" (Spanish), "Brigada Internacional" (German), 85 photographs ranging from the Spanish Civil War era to the 1970s, 3 postcards, and a few articles about Spain.</p>
