            <p>The Central Trades and Labor Council of the American Federation of Labor merged with the New York City Congress of Industrial Organizations Council on February 19, 1959 to form the New York City Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO. This followed the earlier merger (on December 9, 1958) of the New York State's AFL &amp; CIO.</p>
            <p>The New York City Central Labor Council is an organization comprised of nearly 400 local union affiliates. It only acts on local activities and concerns. It issues no statements on AFL-CIO policy and does not participate in its local affiliates and their parent organizations. Its purpose, according to its constitution, is to further the rights of workers to organize in unions and bargain collectively; to advocate legislation which is beneficial to workers and oppose that which is not; to correct abuses and to insure the workers their just rights. It also has more social and political purposes: to help all people who work for a living improve their working conditions and raise their standard of living; preserve their rights to act together for mutual aid and advancement; further the cause of unions; strengthen civil rights. It acts as the central force, providing assistance and education through its various committees and councils.</p>
            <p>The regular activities of the New York City Central Labor Council are directed by its executive officers, Executive Board, and Delegates' Council meetings. The planning and execution of programs and conferences are conducted by various standing and special committees. These committees are composed of members from affiliated local unions, each with officers and advisory consulting staffs. They are responsible for specific programs and conferences. An important special committee is the Labor Day Parade Committee.</p>
            <p>Harry Van Arsdale was elected the president of the Central Trades and Labor Council of the AFL in 1957. With the merger in 1959 he became the President of the Central Labor Council. During his presidency (1957-1986), the council established many diverse committees and programs such as the Rehabilitation Council (1963), Hispanic Labor Committee (1970), and the Black Trade Unionist Leadership Committee (1972). The Council was also instrumental in the founding of the Harry Van Arsdale Jr. Center for Labor Studies, in 1971, at Empire State College, State University of New York, to further labor education.</p>
            <p>Upon Harry Van Arsdale's demise in 1986, his son, Thomas Van Arsdale was elected to the post of president.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The collection consists of approximately 8,200 mostly 8x10 black and white glossy prints. Many were shot for potential use in Labor Chronicle, the Council's newspaper (published between the 1960s and early 1980s) and other Council publications.</p>
            <p>The images span the 1940s through the late 1990s, although the bulk of them date from the 1970s and 1980s. Major areas within the collection include demonstrations by Council affiliates on various issues, and annual Council activities and events, such as the New York City Labor Day Parade, or the Council's annual Lincoln's Birthday Dinner, which features the bestowal of Annual Distinguished Services Awards on four trade unionists. This event is well-represented in the collection as are many of the Council's special committees.</p>
            <p>Individuals are also well-represented, both in portraits and group shots. These include the presidents of the various locals that are represented on the Council, Executive Board members, and of course, the officers of the Council. The officers seen most often are: Harry Van Arsdale, President; Harry Avrutin, Secretary; Morris Iushewitz, Secretary (Avrutin's immediate predecessor); and William Bowe, Treasurer. Of particular interest, the collection also includes numerous photographs of many major New York City and New York State political figures and office-holders, from the 1940s onwards, shown posed with Council members or other labor leaders at events such as the New York City Labor Day Parade. These include mayors Robert F. Wagner, Jr., Abraham Beame, Edward Koch, Rudolph Giuliani, and governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki.</p>
            <p>The principal photographers in the collection (whose credit lines may be seen stamped on the back of many of the images).are Sam Reiss, Alexander Archer, Dan Miller, Jules Geller, and Mildred Gross.</p>
