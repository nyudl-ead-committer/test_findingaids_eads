            <abstract id="ref81" label="Abstract">Sam Wallach (1909-2001) was a school teacher and President of the Teachers' Union, 1945-1948. He was fired by the New York City Board of Education in 1951 for refusal to cooperate with various bodies investigating Communism. The collection includes correspondence; clippings; materials relating to his suspension, dismissal and subsequent reinstatement; his FBI surveillance file and items from his second career working with the mentally retarded. Rose Russell (1899-1965), another teacher who became a leader in the Teachers' Union, is also represented in the collection.</abstract>

            <p>The three series making up the collection are described below:</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I: Personal Papers, 1937-2001.</emph> Directly related to Sam Wallach's personal life, this series contains correspondence, notes, published and unpublished writings, and transcripts of several interviews. Legal documents, newspaper clippings and official communications relating to his suspension and dismissal from public school teaching, along with letters of support from former students, are included in the series. There are also many items concerned with his subsequent reinstatement. Of particular interest is his lengthy FBI file, obtained under the Freedom of Information/Privacy Act in 1998.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II: Rose Russell Material, 1921-1965. </emph> The bulk of this series is correspondence, much of it in the form of tributes to Rose Russell on celebrating the tenth and twentieth anniversaries of her association with the Teachers' Union. Tenth anniversary tributes (1954) come from union representatives, university professors, attorneys, politicians and religious leaders; correspondents include such well-known individuals as W. E. B. DuBois, Joseph P. Selly, Morris Schappes, Cedric Belfrage and Scott Nearing. In 1964, at the twentieth anniversary celebration, Russell was presented with several leather binders full of tributes. Among them are letters and telegrams from notables such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King, Langston Hughes, Abraham Beame, Frederic Ewen, I. F. Stone, Irving Adler, Linus Pauling, Alexander Meiklejohn, Corliss Lamont, and a host of state senators and assemblymen, journalists, Board of Education members and staff, union members, court officers, representatives of a wide variety of organizations and personal friends. The Irish playwright Sean O'Casey corresponded with Ms. Russell for a number of years. One of his letters in the collection, a moving condolence written on November 20, 1963, after the assassination of President Kennedy, was subsequently published in

            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series III: Subject Files, 1935-1999.</emph> This series contains a variety of materials touching on subjects and individuals of interest to Sam Wallach with particular emphasis on the Teachers' Union and its activities. There are also many items collected by Wallach on the topic of mental retardation.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Born in Dolina, Poland, on July 1, 1909, Sam Wallach came to the United States with his parents when he was about 10 months old. He grew up in Brooklyn, the oldest of four children. After attending Brooklyn Technical High School, he studied at City College of the City of New York, graduating in 1929. He was a playground director in Brooklyn and then a high school teacher of economics and history. He joined the Teachers' Union and became one if its leaders, serving as President from 1945 until 1948.</p>
            <p>In 1948, Wallach was called by the Hartley Congressional Labor Committee in its investigation of the Teachers Union. He repeatedly asserted that the Committee had no right to investigate personal or political beliefs. His statement, published in 
                <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>, was defended by sixty notable thinkers and educators, including Albert Einstein.</p>
            <p>In 1949 The New York State Legislature passed the Feinberg Law, which demanded that the Board of Education seek out subversives and Communists and bar them from teaching. From 1951 to 1956, dozens of city school teachers were dismissed and blacklisted; Sam Wallach was one of the first.</p>
            <p>He worked in a variety of jobs after his dismissal, including creating educational filmstrips for National Teaching Aids, and then took a position at Maimonides Developmental Center advocating for mentally retarded children. He helped formulate strategy for "mainstreaming" students and for establishing residential group homes for the retarded.</p>
            <p>In December, 1976, as he was about to retire from Maimonides, he and nine of the other teachers who had been dismissed in the 1950s, were reinstated and awarded pension benefits by the New York City Board of Education.</p>
            <p>Sam Wallach was married for 56 years to Lottie Tanenbaum. They had two daughters, Joan Wallach Scott and Ruth Wallach Frankel. Wallach died on February 14, 2001, at the age of 91.</p>
