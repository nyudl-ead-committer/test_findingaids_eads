            <p>The New York Building Congress (NYBC) is an association representing the construction industry in New York City. Founded in 1921, it now represents 400 organizations totalling over 250,000 skilled workers and professionals. It focuses on supporting sound public policy, promoting productive capital spending, encouraging public/private partnerships, and evaluating the implementation of major government projects in the construction sector.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the First World War, elements of the American building industry attempted to organize a national building congress. Although the planned national organization was never very active, the impulse was continued by city-wide groups. In New York City, the 47-member NYBC was organized in early 1921. Originally, membership was limited to organizations (labor unions, businesses, government agencies, etc.), but it was soon opened to individuals. One of its key responsibilities in its early years was to mediate between labor and management. The broadly based NYBC has brought together representatives of labor and employers, as well as members of the multitude of professions involved in all aspects of the building industry.</p>
            <p>From its start until the 1960s, the NYBC was heavily involved in setting standards in many areas for the building industry. In its first year, the NYBC issued a code of ethics for the industry. Its later standard-making, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, was concerned more with specific building practices and with safety issues. The NYBC has long been deeply involved in legislation and regulations relating to the building industry. For example, it took a leading role in the revision of the New York City building code in the 1960s; and it has lobbied on more general issues, such as the New York City charter revision of the late 1980s, the Westway project, and a variety of other development proposals for the city.</p>
            <p>Over the years the organizational structure of the NYBC varied dramatically, as can be seen in the multitude of committees, subcommittees, councils, and boards listed in the inventory below. Nevertheless, some functions have remained consistent. From the beginning, the NYBC has regularly sponsored research, held conferences, presenhted awards to leaders in the industry, and hosted dinners and luncheons that have been addressed by some of New York's, and the nation's, most distinguished individuals.</p>
            <p>Following the long presidencies of John J. Collins and Louis J. Coletti, the NYBC has been led by Richard T. Anderson since 1994. During this recent period, the Congress organized the New York Building Foundation (NYBF), which undertakes industry research and philanthropic activities.</p>

            <p>The collection consists of the administrative, general, and event files of the NYBC, as well as some publications and audio-visual materials produced by or for the organization. It documents the organization's role in establishing standards for construction through the Building Industry Practices Committee, as well as its important role in New York City legislative issues. The event files cover a variety of activities, from the lavishly produced Christmas shows and "Fun and Frolic" celebrations held from the 1930s through 1980s, to the conferences and issue-oriented forums that became a prominent feature of Congress activity in the 1990s and beyond.</p>
