From the 1960s through the 1980s, O’Malley was active in the New York Irish community, joining various cultural, academic and social organizations. This collection includes materials regarding Irish-American and Irish cultural, educational, charitable, historical and political affairs. It consists of correspondence, newsletters, brochures and promotional material for the American Committee for Ulster Justice, the Irish American Cultural Institute, and the Irish American National Bicentennial Committee. Also included are articles and texts about the Northern Ireland political and military crisis during the 1970s and lobbying material for the 1972 U.S. Congressional Hearings on Northern Ireland. O’Malley collected the materials through his contacts with various organizations in the Irish communities in New York, Boston, and Dublin, and his involvement with the struggle for civil rights in Northern Ireland.</abstract>

            <p>In 1980 Cormac O’Malley deposited 27 cubic feet of material in the archives of St. John’s University, Jamaica, NY. It remained unprocessed and unused for the next 20 years. In December 2000, while President of the Board of Advisors for New York University’s Glucksman Ireland House, O’Malley transferred the collection to the Archives of Irish America at the Tamiment Library as a permanent donation.</p>

            <p>Cormac Kevin Hooker O’Malley was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1942. His father was Irish revolutionary, author and patron of the arts Ernie O’Malley (1897-1957) and his mother was American artist and socialite Helen Huntington Hooker (1905-1993). Upon the death of his father, O’Malley left Ireland to finish his education in the United States, obtaining a BA from Harvard in 1965 and a JD from Columbia University in 1970. He pursued a career in international law in New York, first with Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle, then, from 1981 with Bristol-Myers, living in Mexico, Brussels, London, and New York according to the dictates of his career. In the 1990s, upon retirement from Bristol-Myers Squibb, O’Malley became active as an advisor to Glucksman Ireland House at New York University.</p>
            <p>When in New York, O’Malley was involved with the Irish-American community, joining various cultural, academic, and social organizations, such as the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in the City of New York, the American Committee (later Conference) for Irish Studies, and the Irish Arts Center in New York. During the 1970s-1980s, O’Malley served as an officer or on the board of four such groups: the American Irish Historical Society, the Irish American National Bicentennial Committee, the Ireland Fund (now the American Ireland Fund) and the National University of Ireland Club. O’Malley also had an interest in the civil rights struggle in Northern Ireland. From 1971-1978 he served as national coordinator for the American Committee for Ulster Justice, a group of Irish American lawyers and activists intent on eliminating anti-Catholic discrimination and exposing British complicity in "The Troubles."</p>
            <p>O'Malley is the author of "The Publication History of 
                <title render="italic">On Another Man's Wound</title>" in 
                <title render="italic">New Hibernia Review</title>7:3 (2003): 136-139 and co-author with Keith Highet of 
                <title render="italic">Current Aspects of Doing Business in Black Africa</title>(American Bar Association, 1975).</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The bulk of material included in this collection reflects O’Malley’s involvement in various Irish American cultural, social, academic, and political organizations between 1964 and 1981.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I: Subseries A</emph> includes correspondence, promotional material, bulletins and notes for several Irish and Irish American cultural, charitable, educational and academic organizations of which O’Malley was an officer or member, including the American Irish Foundation, An Taisce (National Trust for Ireland), and the Canadian Association for Irish Studies. Two folders should especially be noted: the New York Shakespeare Festival’s 1973 memorial to Jack MacGrowan and the 1975 donation of the James A. Healy Collection to the Sligo Museum and Library. Series I is further divided into five subseries.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I: Subseries B</emph> contains materials related to the American Irish Historical Society, founded in 1897. During the period of O’Malley’s involvement (1968-1981), the AIHS was located on Fifth Avenue at 80th Street in New York City. This subseries includes materials related to the society’s art and library. Of note is an index to the Journal of the AIHS that O’Malley drafted in 1974.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I: Subseries C</emph> relates to the Irish American Cultural Institute, founded in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1962. O’Malley was involved with this organization between 1967 and 1981, particularly with its Irish Fortnight Series of lectures in New York which brought guests over from Ireland to speak on a variety of cultural topics.</p>
            <p>The papers of the Irish American National Bicentennial Committee (1973-1978) comprise 
                <emph render="bold">Series I: Subseries D</emph>. Established to involve Irish Americans in the 1976 activities surrounding the two hundredth anniversary of the founding of the United States, the IANBC had chapters in several states through which it sponsored events and projects, such as the participation of the Irish tall ship Creidne in Operation Sail. Of note in this subseries is O’Malley’s "Planning Guide to an Irish American Bicentennial Celebration in Your Community" (1975) and an index card file of select people in the Irish American community on the east coast (1974-1975). The cards contain contact information, descriptions and some notes.</p>
            <p>O’Malley’s membership in the New York branch of the National University of Ireland Club from 1968-1981 is reflected in 
                <emph render="bold">Series I: Subseries E</emph>.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II</emph> includes organizational and research materials generated by O’Malley while he served national coordinator for the American Committee for Ulster Justice between 1971 and 1978. Established by Irish American lawyers and activists in response to civil rights violations in Northern Ireland following the outbreak of the "Troubles" in 1969, the ACUJ focused on educating and lobbying American politicians who might intercede with the British government. ACUJ correspondence, memoranda, notes, press releases and publications form 
                <emph render="bold">Series II. Subseries A</emph>. In late February 1972, in the aftermath of Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland, the ACUJ participated in a U.S. Congressional hearing before the House of Representatives’ Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. Materials directly related to this hearing, such as the Kennedy-Ribicoff Resolutions on Violence in Northern Ireland, make up 
                <emph render="bold">Series II. Subseries B</emph>, while the research materials used to inform ACUJ testimony at this hearing make up 
                <emph render="bold">Series II. Subseries C</emph>. These latter files include extensive clippings from Irish and American newspapers and magazines, the Parliament of Northern Ireland debates (1971-1972) and statements of individuals to the Association for Legal Justice in Belfast that same winter. Of particular interest are the 1972 platforms of the American Democratic and Republican political parties on the situation in Northern Ireland; position papers released by the British and Irish governments; the Amnesty International Report of an Enquiry into Allegations of Ill-treatment in Northern Ireland; and press coverage around St. Patrick’s Day 1972, in the wake of the congressional hearing.</p>
            <p>A variety of publications and clippings from U.S. and Irish sources regarding Irish America, Ireland, and Northern Ireland make up 
                <emph render="bold">Series III</emph>. There are two files worth noting, both connected to the American Bicentennial in 1976 that contain newspaper articles on the Irish in America or on connections between Ireland and the United States. This series also contains the 
                <title render="italic">Hibernia Fortnightly Review</title>, a bi-weekly publication from Dublin.</p>
            <p>Two scrapbooks that O’Malley acquired or created comprise 
                <emph render="bold">Series IV: Ephemera</emph>. The first relates to James Brendan Connolly (1868-1957), a South Boston athlete who competed and won at the 1896 Olympics; this scrapbook was assembled by James A. Healy in 1957. The second scrapbook is about William Butler Yeats and the Sligo Museum, related to the Healy donation in 1975 with which O’Malley was involved (see Series I). The last box contains posters announcing various musical, political, and cultural events from the 1980s and later.</p>
